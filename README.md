### What is this?
My attempt at making a "cryptocurrency" for a local network. No, not over the internet with big fancy servers, just in a local network. I'm not experienced in network programming or in the workings of cryptocurrency, so developement is going to be slow.

### Why?
To help me learn and for fun.
